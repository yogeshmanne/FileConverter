This Notes comprises of the Information about PySimpleGUI and its advantages.

PySimpleGUI is an open source, cross-platform GUI library for Python. 
It aims to provide a uniform API for creating desktop GUIs based on Python’s Tkinter, PySide and WxPython toolkits. 
PySimpleGUI also has a port for Remi which is useful for building GUIs for the web. 

PySimpleGUI supports both Python 3.x versions as well as Python 2.7 version. 
The main port, PySimpleGUI doesn’t have any external dependencies, as Tkinter - on which it is based - is a part of Python’s standard library, and hence it needn’t be installed separately. 

Install it in the current Python3 environment by the PIP installer as follows :

pip3 install PySimpleGUI

To verify if the library is correctly installed, enter the following statement −

>>> import PySimpleGUI
>>> PySimpleGUI.version
'4.60.1 Released 22-May-2022'

Example Code :

import PySimpleGUI as psg
layout = [[psg.Text(text='Hello World',
   font=('Arial Bold', 20),
   size=20,
   expand_x=True,
   justification='center')],
]
window = psg.Window('HelloWorld', layout, size=(715,250))
while True:
   event, values = window.read()
   print(event, values)
   if event in (None, 'Exit'):
      break
window.close()


Advantages of using PySimpleGUI in the Project :

1. PySimpleGUI provides a high-level abstraction over the more complex Tkinter, allowing you to create GUIs with fewer lines of code.

2. PySimpleGUI allows for the quick creation of layouts and GUI elements, enabling rapid prototyping and testing of ideas.

3. Platform Independence and easy Integration.

4. Clear and Organised Code
